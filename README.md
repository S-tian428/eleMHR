# eleMHR
eleMHR is a computational method for discovering mutation hotspot regions in genomic elements (CDS, 3UTR, 5UTR, promoters, splice site, etc.) to identify cancer driver genes genome-wide.eleMHR quantifies the enrichment of somatic mutations and detects mutation hotspot regions in genomic elements based on mutation set enrichment analysis. 

Two major inputs are required by eleMHR: a set of genomic regions of interest element, and a set of somatic mutations in a tumor cohort, they are all in tab-separated text files. The element files we provide have two reference genomes containing hg19 and hg38. Users can make their selection based on the reference genome of somatic mutations.
